# Vulpinian Skies-1.0b1
Initial Beta Release

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies-1.0b2
Updated and fleshed out starter guide and tweaked some configs 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies-1.0b3

- Added a custom menu screen with the help of  @Quantum !  Added mods: FancyMenu and its dependency Konkrete
- Added a relatively small mod that changes a significant part of the game: Better Combat. This is a tentative mod and is in TESTING. It may cause issues with other mods, or people may not like it. Please make your feedback about this mod known! Library PlayerAnimator has been added as a dependency for this mod. 
- Updated Guide book with Waystone info
- Rebalanced Waystone teleporting: Made teleportation costs significantly more expensive. The reasoning is that the Waystones mod was originally not even intended to be on the pack given that it would discourage the use of other features the modpack was built around cough cough ships and teleportation in general is probably underestimated in terms of power.  Players will still have the ability and option to teleport, but it will be  not be something that is simply taken for granted, and it will be a significant investment in XP, so it will be a rarer commodity in the early game and an XP sink to late-game players.  Apart from that, the recipe of the key item used to craft the different types of waystones has been made more expensive, and waystones around the world have been made rarer. With the defaults, it feels like those things are handed out like candy! Now they should feel like a slightly more valuable magical device that actually feels good to find and craft.  I swear this is not meant to be a "sense of pride and accomplishment" type of change, but a way to make Waystones actually fit into the pack. There are other methods of teleporting apart from this  mod, and those will be balanced in upcoming patches, but THE teleportation mod is the first one getting looked at.  The in-game guide will have detailed documentation on the cost of waystone teleports and things.
- Added a new Building category mod: Crystal Clear (Create add-on). Minor mod that adds some very fancy-looking glass casings, allowing you to encase create contraptions and gears in see-through casings!
- Updated a major mod, as it has come out of Beta officially (Ice and Fire: Dragons)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies-1.0b4
Trader Goblins and Guns!

- Added the first custom trades to Goblin Traders:  Balloons (Common)(temporary trade), Warp Stone, Grenade (Uncommon), All the current Starter Capsules (rare), Thumper grenade launcher (Epic),  Ancient Tomes of Efficiency, Unbreaking, and Fortune. Also tweaked Goblin Trader config file.
- Added simple recipe to allow turning Mossy Waystones back to regular Waystones
- Rebalanced Guns from CGM and Scorchedguns (mainly nerfs or mini-reworks to highly overpowered guns):
 - LG8 Grenade Launcher: Reduced rate of fire from 7 to 9 (lower is faster) and reduced damage from 65 to 15 to match other grenade launchers.
 - Dozier GL: Increased magazine size from 1 to 6 so that it has a proper place as a semi-auto grenade launcher, and increased rate of fire from 8. Was previously just outclassed by all other grenade launchers.
 - Cyclone: Highly reduced firing rate, from 4 to 10 and increased spread because this weapon can cause untold devastation in a very short period of time.
- "S Class" weapons are all receiving heavy nerfs. They're end-game weapons but still way too strong.
 - The Officer's Special: Reduced damage from 35 to 15 
 - The Cosmic Blitzer: Reduced damage from 55 to 21, increased magazine size from 5 to 9, decreased fire rate from 5 to 6
 - R498 Gauss Cannon: Reduced damage from 64 to 36 and reduced fire rate from 1 to 3, reloadAmount decreased from 15 to 5 (reloads slower)
 - Alfonz Repeating Punter: Increased damage (this is still a nerf overall) from 160 to 180, increased spread from 4 to 18, spread out damage from 6 projectiles to 54,  Ammo type changed from Osborne slug to Ethereal Shell. This is to rework a shotgun-type weapon that was a little too effective from a long distance for a shotgun and didn't feel much like a shotgun.
 - Astella:  Damage reduced from 120 to 60
 - Alfonz Turnpike: Damage reduced from 45 to 27, magazine size increased from 12 to 24 (yes, that's a buff), reload amount decreased from 12 to 6 (it's slower to reload now), increased spread from 15 to 16
 - The Earth's Corpse: Damage reduced from 28 to 12, magazine capacity reduced from 65 to 64 (it's a prettier number), now its bullets' damage drops off with distance, and a spread of 2.0 has been added (this gun had little to no downsides, and reached ridiculous DPS levels) 

- New recipes (including Create-based ones) have been added for ammo and ammo materials, and one gun:
 - Grenade
 - Stun Grenade
 - Powder and Ball
 - Simple Bullet
 - Shotbolt
 - Blasphemy (weapon)
 - Volatile scrap
 - ... and a lot more to come 

- Items renamed and descirptions added: Collectible coin counterparts were renamed to "Antique X Coin" due to naming conflicts, and added desciption clarifying that they're not legal tender (will not be part of future currency system).

- Added a lot of info to modpack guide book about munitions manufacturing in a new entry: Ballistics (still a wip) 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies-1.0b5f
This is a major patch that introduces a lot of unified and custom content for the modpack, overhauling more than one system in an effort to make the most sensible and congruent experience possible. A number of mods were removed, and a number were added.

## Finalized overhaul of munition crafting, which unifies mods, makes recipes more involved and generally more resource-intensive, and thus makes ammo a much more valuable resource.
- First, completely new items were added to be part of the recipes for a few ammo types, and some were altered or repurposed for unification and minimization of cluttersome redundancy.
- Individual Munitions:
 - NEW ITEM Unstable Encased Fire (intermediary item for Encased Fire), can be used as fuel.
 - NEW ITEM Uncharged EC Rounds, crafted with pure gunpowder (which got a slight QoL recipe upgrade), needs to be charged with Tesla Coil to turn into an EC round.
 - Removed Bronze Tin ingot from the game (hidden from JEi, tags and recipe removed. This will be the "standard" way to remove items) and replaced it with brass ingot. Iit was an ingot that did only one thing in another recipe and looked extremely similar to brass anyway.
  - Therefore, changed Scorched Bronze recipe to use Brass, Copper, and 2 Blaze Powder.
 - Created new recipes using the new Scorched Bronze Ingots for:
  - Scorched Bullets
  - Scorched Big Bullets
  - Scorched Big Shells
 - Brass-based recipe for Heavy Bullets
 - Now  Hell Gunpowder has been renamed to Hellpowder and has been unified with Create: Big Canon's Nitropowder process.
  - made new Pig Round, Heavy Pig Round, and Quartz Shell recipes with it.
  - Removed scorchedguns's Nitro Dust and replaced instances of its use for Createbigcannon's Nitropowder
  - Made new Osborne Slug recipe with it.
 - New Experimental Round recipe (hint: it uses experience).
 - The end-game munitions (ethereal ammo, the one used by S Class guns) were overhauled. Now Ars Nouevau has been integrated into the creation, and magic wil be required to obtain the final tier of ammo.

## Gun Rebalancing
- Huot Auto: recoilAngle reduced from 25 to 6 and recoilKick reduced from 19 to 3.5 (this is a buff, gun felt pretty awkward to shoot before), reloadAmount reduced from 16 to 4 (slight nerf)
- SC Deputy: Damage raised from 25 to 64 (gun was very weak amongs its peers, and for the expensiveness of the bullets it used. The spread was too much, so this should help it out)
- Soul Drummer: Reduced recoil angle from 8 to 5 (this is a buff. It should help make it a little less awkwar to shoot and help it fit better among its peers)
- Spitfire: Reloadamount reduced from 20 to 5 (reloads slower now). Increased Projectile amount from 6 to 8 (a nerf or a buff in some cases, just changes the feel of the gun mainly, making it feel more flamethrower-y), Damage increased from 10 to 18  to compensate, as well at to separate it from similar gun Blasphemy
- Tunk: Damage increased from 22 to 70, same reason as SC Deputy
- Buffed damage of some S Class guns that were overnerfed:
 - Officer's Special: 15 to 20
 - Cosmic Blitzer: 21 to 27
 - Astella: 60 to 90
 - Earth's Corpse: spread 2 to 4, lifetime 40 to 32
 
## Misc. Changes
- Updated 40+ mods
- Optimized book with macros (back-end only, this has no visual impact)
- Moved resourcepacks and datapacks from their regular folders to KubeJS assets and data folders for loading. This streamlines the process, removes competition in the form of load order, makes things more maintainable on the back end-
- Storms and Tornadoes (Weather 2)
 - Significantly Nerfed the SPAWN RATE of tornadoes and cyclones.
 - Note that they are not any less destructive. They will just be rare, more memorable events 

## Mod Removals
Removed mods due to game-breaking bugs/incompatibility:
 - Oculus
 - Team Abnormals Mods
  - Buzzier bees
  - Blueprint
  - Berry good
  - Autumnity
  - Atmospheric
  - Environmental
  - Abnormals delight
 - Journey Maps (this was only a temporary mod)
 - Ars Omega.
 - Mods that are meant to be used for dev but not end users as much:
  - Extended item information
  - Spark
  - Tellme
 - Removed some mods that were completely or majorly redundant with other mods:
  - Storagedrawers
  - Liquidburner 

## Mod Additions

- Friends and Foes
- Born in Chaos
- Gateways to Eternity
- Floating Islands
- mmmmmmmmmmmm (dummy mod)
- Aquamirae (and its dependency Obscure API)
- Undergarden
- Shutup Experimental Settings
- Additional banners
- Bedspreads
- Performance mods:
 - Lightspeed
 - Culllessleaves

## Further Gun Customization
- Separate all guns to distinct tiers, which are classes based on their Single-shot damage, Ammo Type, DPS, Effective Range, and Utility
- Completely overhauled the gun recipe system.
 - Now guns are no longer crafted in the workbench along with ammo (the workbench is used only for accessories now), and a Class X Frame system has been developed, with information on the guide book. Each tier has a frame, and each tier uses progressively more and more expensive ingredients, according to game progression. 
 - There have been great strides in unifying recipes, resources, and materials.
 - Diamond items have been tagged, for instance, based on how many diamodns were used to craft them, so that they may be melted down into molten diamond, which is used in some high-tier recipes, espeically for guns and ammo
 - Tweaked some Class G, F, and S guns
 
 ## Vulpinian Skies Core
 - New mod by me, which *unifies* the modpack, fills in gaps, tweaks stuff that cannot be reached via datapacks or KubeJS and such.
 - Currently the main thing it does is:
  - Adds a custom ammo type: Ethereal Grenades, for Class S weapon as those were missing.
  - The LG8 was therefore changed to use these for ammo. They are way more expensive and hard to craft than regular grenades, but also way more destructive.
  
## Vulpinian Structures
  The modpack now has custom structures that are generetable in any biomee and dimension!
   - Added an Undergarden dungeon that spawns rarely in most overworld biomes. Has randomly-generated rooms and has hints on how to get to the Underworld
   
## Vulpinian Skies Fix
he long, long-awaited fix for a critical bug that was impacting the experience significantly, thanks to CCr4ft3r for developing the fix. The issue was preventing the modpack from launching, causing a significant amount of boot-ups to fail, and 1/3 of the cause why this patch took so long to come out. Go check out CCr4f3r's performance mods at https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/ccr4ft3r/projects (many of them have now been added to the pack at this point).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies 1.0b6 - Moar Noms!
Another major patch adding further unification and swaping some mods for others, as well as doing a lot of work on mod configs.

## Mod Additions

### Food-related Mods
- Create Centralized Kitchen
 - This mod serves to unify and centralize cooking, allowing many compatibilities between the food mods, allowing more and more food to be automated and industrialized.
- Miner's Delight
 - NEW foods. These ones are quite peculiar and unique. The food for miners and cavedwellers!
 - Compatible with Create Centralized Kitchen, too.
- There is a small new performance mod by CCr4t3r.
- There is also a new mod that makes significant changes in how damage works: BetterHurtTimer
 - Basically, invincibility frames will no longer be a thing; this will be a major buff to anything that deals damage quickly, guns for example.
 
### Other Mods
Added some additional, small new mods:
- Botany Trees
 - allows trees to be planted in Botany Pots.
- LevelTextFix
 - fixes the display enchantments that are over lvl 10.
 - The default is in Roman Numerals, but can be changed to regular old Arabic numbers.
- Tips
- Now there will be custom tips that will show during loading screen and in the menu, detailing some useful features of the modpack as well as things that are unique to the modpack. Oh one or two tips might be sussy :Smug:
 
## Mod Removals
- Chisels and Bits
 - Reason: mod has been unstable with some significant issues, and it has finally come to a point where it will certainly break with the future update of a major mod: Create 0.5.1.
 - Can be reintroduced if the single maintainer of the mod finds the time to give a much-needed support patch for C&B for 1.18.2.
- Pneumaticccraft
 - The mod simply has been deemed to not fit the modpack and stick out in a weird way.
 - Its compat mod Pressurized Creativity has thus also been removed.
 
## Mod Updates
45+ mods were updated, some with major content while others smaller.

## Spice of Life: Carrot
- (Eat food to get more hearts mod):  Configured file to account for all 1717 foods in the pack. You  start with 5 hearts and gain a heart every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 ,80... new foods. A total of 174 extra hearts can be obtained, for a total of 179 hearts per player. Farmers and cooks rejoice! 
- Check your food progress in the book with the carrot on it (one is included in every Starter Hut, and can be crafted with a book and a carrot)

## Ice and Fire
- Made dragon roosts spawn way less. The world was too many dragons. Overpopulated. 
- In turn, buffed dragons significantly. Finding a dragon now is going to be a memorably experience.
- Dragon eggs will now take 24 IRL hours to hatch.
- The spawn area should be well protected and clear of dragons and dragon structures, so go about 10k blocks out to start finding them.

## Spawn Balance Utility
- Did major work on spawns
 - Born in Chaos mobs, mozwiez, and many others were removed from dimensions they shouldn't spawn in at all.
 - Spawn rates were also reduced for BIC, GoG, and HMaG.
 - A lot of other mobs were also tweaked, as far as the biomes they spawn in and weights.
 - Seared Spirits: Natural spawning disabled due to never despawning bug
 
## Regions Unexplored
- Mod has been updated, and for the server, the world type will be set to Large Biomes as too many microbiomes were found in beta testing.
- Overworld biomes have been improved by the mod, and fully new biomes can be found in the Nether!

## Ars Nouveau
-  Magic trees are now 20x rarer in the world, to compensate for new large biomes that make them easier to find expansive and populated forests, for example.

## Capsule
- About 250+ blocks have been added to the override list.
- This means that now most  blocks like grass, flowers, random rocks, and other such foliage and ground decorations shouldn't block capsules from deploying.
- @Beta Tester IF YOU FIND SUCH A BLOCK THAT BLOCKS CAPSULE DEPLOYMENT, REPORT IT. First person to report a block that blocks deployment but shouldn't (like some type of grass or something) will receive a gold coin (will be added to that player's starting balance when the official server starts)

## Vulpinian Coins
- Implemented custom currency system using Create Deco's coins. Coins have been carefully callibrated in conversion rates.
- From least valuable to most valuable: Zinc Coin -> Brass Coin -> Copper Coin -> Cast Iron Coin -> Iron Coin -> Gold Coin -> Netherite Coin
- Coin conversions:
    32 ZC = 1 BC
    64 ZC = 1 CC
    2 BC = 1 CC
    64 BC = 1 CIC
    32 CC = 1 CIC
    2 CIC = 1 IC
    64 CC = 1 IC
    64 IC = 1 GC 
    64 GC = 1 NC
- Coinstacks are just a way to store coins more effectively. There are 8 coins per coinstack. You can also place them down and build piles on coin to flex on some gamers, if you're into that.

## Recipes
- Added Compacting recipes for experience nugets and experience blocks. Now fluid experience can be turned into its solid form!
 - Conversion rate:
  1 millibucket (mB) = 1 XP
  1 Experience Nugget = 3 XP = 3 mB
  1 Experience Block = 9 Experience Nuggets
  
## Quark
- Added some biomes to Pathfinders Maps, which are special maps sold by cartographers.
 - They show you the way to certain biomes, perhaps rare ones.
- Enabled Abacus item, as a distance-measuring tool (since the measuring tape from Chisels and Bits is no more).

# Vulpinian Skies 1.0b7
Small Mod Updates, Fixes, Moar Foods, AND MELTING MELTING, AND MORE MELTING

## Mod Additions
- MyServerIsCompatible
 - Sometimes when you make a server (mainly when you use a proxy), Forge shows an "Incompatible FML modded server" message even if you're still able to join the server.
 - This can end up confusing some players, and it happens with the current hosting service of the official Vulpinian Skies server.
 - This *client-side-only* mod simply removes that error message.
- End's Delight
 - End-themed foods to spice up your life in the End!

## Mod Updates
- Updated 10 mods with minor updates

## Recipes
Oh boy, there's a lot of them this patch.

### Basin Melting
- Added recipes of type Basin Melting from Create: Big Cannons, that allow a high number of materials, including most metals and gems, to be melted down to liquid form. This allows fairly efficient reclamation of material from items and blocks containing it.
- Most of these recipes use tags to include large numbers of blocks as ingredients.
- Hundreds of items are now meltable, allowing their respective materials to be reclaimed.
- Affected materials include:
 - Emerald
 - Clay 
 - Glass
 - Obsidian
 - Ender
 - Amethyst
 - Debris
 - Netherite
 - Iron
 - Gold
 - Copper
 - Zinc
 - Brass
 - Silver
 - All of Tinkers own special metals and alloys (tho this might need to be fleshed out later)
 - And more to come...
- New recipes were also added to all the ores of the included materials wherever applicable, which now produce lava, experience, and that ore's material in liquid form!

## Fixes
- Fixed some issues with tags not loaded correctly, which was the reason why some items, including certain hamburgers, were not craftable due to ingredient tags displaying as a :no_aec: A new mod called lmft was added which automatically handles this issue, but if the mod becomes problematic for any reason, there is a manual approach that can be done to deal with the issue. However, that approach is more convoluted and prone to error, so the mod is preferable.
- Some small recipe fixes
- Got rid of some redundant items, including iron rods from one Create add-on, where Create Additions had an iron rod that has better tags and was already applicable in more recipes
 - Recipies and tags were unified in this regard
- Deleted an experimental and incomplete feature that was occasionally causing crashes on startup and probably other instabilities (WIP Antique Atlas stuff)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies 1.0b8
Diesel Engines, Necroethanol, Gun Fix

## Mod Additions
- Create: Diesel Engines.
 - Now your contraptions can go Vroom vroom!
 - Added and did a lot of custom stuff for this new mod
  - Configured existing fluids to work nicely with the engines, unifying mods and setting up fuel recipes, including the creation of an entirely new fuel craftable with Virulent Mix from the Undergarden and some other ingredients: Necroethanol.
  - Added ways to get virulent mix via fermenting Rotten Blisterberries
  - Added seed tags to other Undergarden seeds so seed oil can be extracted via pressing as with other seeds.
  - Fuels were properly tagged and data-driven tooltips were added that will give information as to their properties when used with engines.
  
## Mod Updates
- Updated 4 mods with minor updates:
 - Botany pots
 - Create: Enchantment Industry,
 - Everycomp
 - Nethers Exoticism 
 
## Recipes

### Basin Melting
 - Water (it will make sense)
 
### Basin Fermenting
 - Added a lot of ways to ferment Undergarden items into Virulent Mix
  - This includes fermenting some fruits, mushrom blocks, and such.
 - Reworked the way to get Bioethanol from Create Additions
 - Undergarden Ink Mushrooms are now fermentable into ink from Create: Enchantment Industry.
 
### Mixing
 - The new custom-made fluid and fuel, Necroethanol, can be crafted by mixing Bioethanol, Scintling Goo, and Virulent Mix.

### Pressing
- Tagged Undergarden seed items with the #seed tag so they're properly pressable into Seed Oil.
 - This will also naturally add more compatible items for any recipes and things that use the #forge:seeds tag.
 
## Tips
- Added more tips.

## Script Additions
- Added a server script that prevents gun abuse by setting all other weapons on a half-second cooldown when a weapon is fired, preventing cheese of firing a weapon and immediately switching (super basic mechanic that every good FPS and its mother uses to prevent cheese, which was missing from the gun mods)
- Implemented a server script to track food stuffs from SolCarrot. This means I now have the power to give players special rewards when they reach certain milestones of eating unique foods, including a grand prize if they eat all 1800~ unique foods in the modpack (Food number has increased a lot as more food-related mods have been added, and some custom foods are planned!)

## Fixes
- Fixed a small issue with keybindinds that was causing shift-locked behavior with Quark's Shift Lock feature, and edited relevant Tip.
- Finally added some config fiels to defaultconfigs (I didn't know this was a thing that would apply serverconfig files to new worlds, neat forge feature)
- Probably some other random small tag/recipe fixes or something that i forgor about.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vulpinian Skies 1.0b9 (WIP)

## Mod Additions
- KubeJS Additions
 - For easier access to more events such as player.changed_dimension.
 - Basically for a better coding experience for me, and thus higher-quality scripts.
- Yet Another World Protector
 - It was already added on the server, so is not new
 - It is needed in the client, too, so that messages from it display properly 
- Infinity Buttons
 - All your button needs wrapped up in a lovely little mod
 - Has really good-looking and polished safety buttons, hidden buttons, builtin RNG buttons, and more buttony goodness...
- Potion Bundles
 - Lets you use potions in a cute and more compact way
 - Allows you to craft bundles of 3 potions, which are consummable as-is (have 3 uses, obviosly)

 
## Mod Updates
- Eureka Airships (will remain until Clockwork is read)
- Every Compat
- Moonlight Lib
- Born in Chaos
 - Big update with a lot of new features and polish!

## Misc
- Did a major refactor for items, assets, recipe, and others associated to the namespace ``vulpinian_skies_core`` Mostly back end, does not affect users for the most part, but does make the pack more polished and easier to work with.

## Patchouli
- Fixed some Patchouli stuff with the Vulpinian Skies Guide after the refactor :patchy:

## Script Additions
- Implemented a Login Protection script. It is meant to prevent unfair deaths while you are loading in and cannot control your character. For clarity, **there will be protection when**:
  - You log in (either to server or single-player world)
  - You enter a new dimension by any means
