## Summary

High-effort modpack with extensive customization via KubeJS (which includes hundred of new and modified recipes, fixes, tweaks, more numerous surprises) as well as tailor-made assets to create an artistically cohesive experience, thoughtful mod unification + balancing + config, sensibly customized mob spawns for the many vibrant (and sometimes dark) biomes to explore which also include custom-built datapack structures some of which include elaborate dungeons, a carefully-calibrated currency system with fully overhauled loot tables including intricate NPC trading, advancements with unique rewards, a world of flavor to explore with a myriad meals and dishes with more rewards for tasting new foods, a custom sky populated with mesmerizing celestial objects, 'Starter Hut' capsules that do not clutter new players' inventories, helpfully-written in-game tips on loading screen and menus as well as an immersive in-game book guide, a Vulpinian Skies Core mod to really tie the ribbon the ribbon together, and much more...

Modpack has been in development for about 9 months as of this repo's first commit. There is still much work to do and I am on the grindset, but this is also a team effort as I am getting help in several aspects of the modpack.

It is recommended to enjoy the modpack blindly, but check out the [Modlist](https://github.com/FoxyFox909/Vulpinian-Skies-Modpack/blob/main/MODLIST.md) here if you would like!

## Motivation

In terms of mods, Vulpinan Skies is heavily inspired by Valkyrien Skies and its upcoming Create-based add-on Clockwork; thus, these mods are central to the pack's identity. Other than that, I felt unsatisfied from playing modpacks where the mods felt like islands isolated from one another, lacking even simple like allowing modded tree logs to be turned into Create's Andesite Casing, and I was simply moved by this feeling that modpacks can be so much more if they are given love and attention, with a focus on quality over quantity, so I decided to take it into my own hands with Vulpinian Skies! It is my second modpack, and although it may not be my last, it will be the only one I will focus on for the time being.
Apart from other mods and Minecraft itself, Factorio is a game that heavily inspires me. I am not attempting to recreate Factorio, but definitely honor it and draw from it. Therefore, you can expect special attention to detail in regard anything that even smells of Create. Of course, the rest of the aspects of the pack are still carefully and effortfully being developed. The name of Factorio's developer, "WUBE", is an abbreviation of Wszystko bÄ™dzie, which is supposed to mean something like "Everything will be done eventually." This is part of my philosophy when developing this pack - Things are not rushed, but they're ready when they're ready and polished.
