# Vulpinian Skies Modpack

(MODPACK STILL IN BETA AND NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED)

Version 1.0b8

## Summary

High-effort modpack with extensive customization via KubeJS (which includes hundred of new and modified recipes, fixes, tweaks, more numerous surprises) as well as tailor-made assets to create an artistically cohesive experience, thoughtful mod unification + balancing + config, sensibly customized mob spawns for the many vibrant (and sometimes dark) biomes to explore which also include custom-built datapack structures some of which include elaborate dungeons, a carefully-calibrated currency system with fully overhauled loot tables including intricate NPC trading, a world of flavor to explore with a myriad meals and dishes with unique rewards for tasting new foods, a custom sky populated with mesmerizing celestial objects, 'Starter Hut' capsules that do not clutter new players' inventories, helpfully-written in-game tips on loading screen and menus as well as an immersive in-game book guide, a Vulpinian Skies Core mod to really tie the ribbon the ribbon together, and much more...

Modpack has been in development for about 9 months as of this repo's first commit. There is still much work to do and I am on the grindset, but this is also a team effort as I am getting help in several aspects of the modpack.
